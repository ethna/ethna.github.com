Tutorial
========

Setup 1 Projects
----------------

This section teaches you to build your project 
in just a few steps with Ethna using **command line**.

.. hint::

   Make sure once the Ethna is installed on your computer, you have made 
   changes to your ``php.ini`` files. i.e. pear libraries are in the include
   path. On a Mac, you would do something like the following

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ emacs /etc/php.ini
      
      And then add the appropriate path

      ; include_path = ".:/Users/YOUR-USER-NAME/pear/share/pear/"

   Similarly, make the changes to your php.ini file on other Operating Systems.


Simple Blog Application
+++++++++++++++++++++++


Here, we are going to create a simple blog application with Ethna and ethna's command line tool.

In this tutorial, there are two important learnings

1. ``Ethna`` flow of creating an application
2. How to set up a url


1. Application information
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Before developing an Application, there are two points to keep in mind.

1. Application ID (*must be letters*)
   e.g. miniblog

2. Application Directory. Usually on Linux, it is ``/var/www/``. Although, you may change it your directory by modifying the 
   ``/etc/apache/httpd.config`` file.

In this tutorial, we are going to use ``/var/www/``.

To create a new project command ``ethna add-project AwesomeName``

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd /var/www
   $ ethna add-project miniblog

The above command will create a skeleton for the application. Following is the sample output.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ethna add-project miniblog
   creating directory (/var/www/miniblog) [y/n]: y
   project sub directory created [/var/www/miniblog/app]
   project sub directory created [/var/www/miniblog/app/action]

   ...

   file generated [/usr/share/php/Ethna/skel/skel.view_test.php -> /var/www/miniblog/skel/skel.view_test.php]

   project skeleton for [miniblog] is successfully generated at [/var/www/miniblog]

Above application has been generated.

Verifying the Directory Structure
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Let's take a peek at the directory and the files generated.

::

   | - App (directory of the application) 
   | | - Action (Action Script) 
   | | - plugin (filter script) 
   | | - test (test scripts) 
   | `- View (view script) 
   | - bin ( command line scripts) 
   | - etc (configuration files, etc.) 
   | - lib library) (application 
   | - locale 
   | `- ja_JP 
   | - log (log file) 
   | - schema (DB schema, etc.) 
   | - - skel (skeleton application file) 
   | - template 
   | `- ja_JP (template file) 
   | - tmp (temp files) 
   `- www (web publishing file)

Common use is in the following directory.

- ``app/``
- ``app/action``
- ``app/view``
- ``template/ja_JP``

2. Setting Application's Url
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Although you may see it on the ``localhost/miniblog/www``. Also, in order to access the application from web browser, i.e. ``var/www/``. 
We are going to set the **Apache Virtual Host** to ``http://miniblog.myhost/`` like the following:

::

   <VirtualHost *:80>
      ServerName miniblog.myhost
      DocumentRoot /var/www/miniblog/www
   </VirtualHost>

Set up is complete lets try to view in the browser

:: 

   http://miniblog.myhost/

If the set up is done correctly, you may should be able to see the following output

   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: alternate text
   :align: center

Next we are create action using ethna

Flow of creation & processing: Action, View, Template
------------------------------------------------------

Prior to creating a real application, we are going to add action, view and template to our miniblog.

Create action, view, template
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Next we are going to create action hello, which will be accessible from the following url

::

  http://miniblog.myhost/?action_hello=true

There are 3 things to do

- ``add-action hello``
- ``add-view hello`` 
- ``add-template hello``

Let's jump to the command line and do the above 3 steps.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ethna add-action hello
   file generated [/var/www/miniblog/skel/skel.action.php -> /var/www/miniblog/app/action/Hello.php]
   action script(s) successfully created [/var/www/miniblog/app/action/Hello.php]

   $ ethna add-view hello
   file generated [/var/www/miniblog/skel/skel.view.php -> /var/www/miniblog/app/view/Hello.php]
   view script(s) successfully created [/var/www/miniblog/app/view/Hello.php]

   $ ethna add-template hello
   file generated [/var/www/miniblog/skel/skel.template.tpl -> /var/www/miniblog/template/ja_JP/hello.tpl]
   template file(s) successfully created [/var/www/miniblog/template/ja_JP/hello.tpl]

.. tip::

   You can add a view and template in one command by adding ``-t`` like this 
     ::

       add-view -t hello

Now, the view for the added action named ``hello`` can be viewed in the browser with the following url

::

  http://miniblog.myhost/?action_hello=true

The browser should display the following

Flow of processing in Ethna
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This diagram illustrates the flow of processing Ethna

   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: alternate text
   :align: center

Action
++++++

With the command ``ethna add-action hello``, ``Hello.php`` is created in the directory
``app/action/Hello.php``. In this php file there are two classes. As a courtesy, comments 
are also generated, but for this tutorial I am omitting the comments. The two classes follows next.


.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   class Miniblog_Form_Hello extends Miniblog_ActionForm
   {
        protected $form = array(
     );
   }

   class Miniblog_Action_Hello extends Miniblog_ActionClass
   {
       public function prepare()
       {
           return null;
       }

       public function perform()
       {
           return 'hello';
       }
   }


``Miniblog_Form_Hello``

This is the action form class, and inherits Ethna's ActionForm class.
In this class the form for POST and/or GET is defined. We will discuss 
more about forms later in this documentation.


``Miniblog_Action_Hello``

This class implements the Hello action. Two functions ``prepare()`` and ``perform()``
are called before the implementation transit to *view*.

View
++++

The, view class generated by the command ``ethna add-view hello``, should be in the directory
``app/view/Hello.php``.

.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   class Miniblog_View_Hello extends Miniblog_ViewClass
   {
       public function preforward()
       {
           $message = "Hello World";
           $this-af->setApp('helloVariable',$message);
       }
   }

This is the View class inherits from ethna's View class. View class is responsible
for setting the variables that then be used in the HTML *template*. You may set your variables
in the function ``preforward()``, using ``setApp()``.

Template
++++++++

Last one is template which is created by the command ``ethna add-template hello`` in the 
directory ``template/ja_JP/hello.tpl``

Lets, play with the ``helloVariable`` and try to print it in the template

.. code-block:: php

   <h2> New Template </h2> 
   <p> {$app.helloVariable} </p>


Implementation of Application
------------------------------

Lets start the implementation of creating a blog via learning following 3 things

1. Add action to handle the post, defined in a form.
2. Output the value from the form.
3. Validate the values from input form.

Add action
++++++++++

First is to quickly add an action named ``commit`` by the command ``ethna add-action commit``

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ethna add-action commit
   file generated [/var/www/miniblog/skel/skel.action.php -> /var/www/miniblog/app/action/Commit.php]
   action script(s) successfully created [/var/www/miniblog/app/action/Commit.php]

As the message also shows, there should be a file generated in ``app/action/Commit.php``
Here, there are two classes, 

1. ``class Miniblog_Form_Commit extends Miniblog_ActionForm`` that handles the input fields for the form 
2. ``class Miniblog_Action_Commit extends Miniblog_ActionClass`` that performs actions upon input/submitting the form

Lets take a look at them one by one

Creating Form
+++++++++++++

And in ``app/action/Commit.php`` file.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   class Miniblog_Form_Commit extends Miniblog_ActionForm 
   { 
       protected  $form  =  array( 
           'Comment'  =>  array( 
               'type'  =>  VAR_TYPE_STRING, 
               'form_type'  =>  FORM_TYPE_TEXTAREA, 
               'name'  =>  'comment', 
               'max'  =>  140, 
               'required '  =>  true, 
           ), 
       ); 

   }

Which is:

- Form named **Comments**
- The value type is string
- Form type is TEXTAREA
- 140 Characters
- Required Item

And the second class

.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   class Miniblog_Action_Commit extends Miniblog_ActionClass
   {
       public function prepare()
       {
           return null;
       }
       public function perform()
       {
           return 'index';
       }
   }

We will talk about this second class ``Miniblog_ActionClass`` soon, but first lets create the form to 
be shown in the browser.

Display Form
++++++++++++

Lets display the form in our ``template/ja_JP/index.tpl`` file

.. code-block:: html

   <h2>Post</h2>

   {form name="form_comment" ethna_action="commit"}
     Post Content:
     {form_input name="comment"}

     {form_submit}
    {/form}

``ethna_action`` defines the action to be called. It is similar to doing ``action="commit.php"`` in plain html form.
Similarity other values are self explanatory.


Upon visiting the browser, a page similar to following should appear.

.. image:: ../images/tutorial_03-01.png
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: alternate text
   :align: center

Showing the POST content
++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: html

   <h2>Comment</h2>
   {$form.comment}

This way you should be able to see the post content after the submit button from the text area.
``$form`` is used to access the variables defined in the ActionForm class.

Display Validation and Error content of POST
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Here we explain about the ``Miniblog_ActionClass`` where the validations to the form can be performed.

.. code-block:: php

   public function prepare() 
   {
      if ($this->af->validate() > 0) {
          return 'index';
      }
      return null;
   }

Firstly, ``prepare()`` is called, here the necessary preparations can be done, like assigning values to instances,
performing checks etc.

``$this->af`` is the action form object, while ``validate()`` executes the method that performs validations on the 
input value. The point here is that if there is a trouble with the validation, the next method ``prepare()`` will not
be called and instead the ``index`` will be returned (rendered).

Displaying Errors
+++++++++++++++++

Error content for the form are handled by the variable ``$error``.

.. code-block:: html

   <h2>Posting Comment</h2>
   {if count($errors) > 0}
   There was an error !
   {/if}

   {form name="form_comment" ethna_action="commit"}

    Post Content:<br />
    {message name="comment"}<br />
    {form_input name="comment"}

    {form_submit}

   {/form}

Where the output of the above code would be the following, if the characters in the text area 
are more than 140 or 0.

.. image:: ../images/tutorial_03-02.png
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: alternate text
   :align: center
   


Connection to Database
----------------------

In this section, we talk about the following things

1. Setting Database
2. SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE i.e. basic stuff

Setting Database
++++++++++++++++

Setting database is pretty straight forward with ethna. 
Settings are defined in ``etc/miniblog-ini.php``.
To connect to the database uncomment the ``dsn`` like the following.

.. code-block:: php

  <?php

  $config = array(
     // site
     'url' => '',

     // debug
     // (to enable ethna_info and ethna_unittest, turn this true)
     'debug' => true,

     // db
     // sample-1: single db
     // 'dsn' => 'mysql://user:password@server/database',
     // ...

Replace the 

- ``user`` with your ``DB username``
- ``password`` with your ``password``
- ``server`` with ``localhost`` or ``127.0.0.1``
- ``database`` with your ``database_name``

Save it and good to go

Connecting to Database in Action Class
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following connects to the database in ``app/action/Hello.php``

.. code-block:: php

   function perform()
   {
       $db = & $this->backend->getDB();
       $db->db->setFetchMode(DB_FETCHMODE_OBJ);
   }

SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE with ``$db``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


**SELECT**

.. code-block:: php

   $sql = "SELECT * FROM users where id > ?";
   $params = array("1");
   $stmt = & $db->db->prepare($sql);
   $res = & $db->db->execute($stmt,$params);
   
   echo "<pre>";
   $i = 0;
   while ($data[$i] = $res->fetchRow()) {
      if ($i){
          var_dump($data);
      }
      $i++;
   }
   echo "</pre>";

**INSERT**

.. code-block:: php

    $sql = "INSERT INTO users (username, email, password, osid, gameid,signup) VALUES (?,?,?,?,?,now())";
    $params = array(
         "kevin",
         "dummy@gmail.com",
          sha1("foo"),
          "1111",
          "gamers"
          );
    $stmt = & $db->db->prepare($sql);
    $res = & $db->db->execute($stmt,$params);
     
    //Note that this message only exists in case of DB error         
    if (method_exists($res, 'getMessage')){
        var_dump($res->getMessage());
    }

**UPDATE**

.. code-block:: php

   $sql = "UPDATE puzzle SET playedby=?,solved=?,score=score +100 WHERE id=?";
   $params = array("johny", '1',  "111");
   $stmt = & $db->db->prepare($sql);
   $stmt = & $db->db->execute($stmt,$params);

.. tip::

   Check the other class methods quickly by ``var_dump(get_class_methods($res))``
