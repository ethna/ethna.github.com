Quick Start
===========

Installation is simple using ``PEAR``

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pear channel-discover pear.ethna.jp
   $ pear install -a ethna/ethna

.. Note::

   If permission errors or not able to discover then try with ``sudo`` like 
   
   .. code-block:: bash
  
      $ sudo pear channel-discover pear.ethna.jp

.. Note::

   In ``$ pear install -a ethna/ethna`` we gave the option ``-a`` so that the dependencies are installed together. Hence, it is advicable to say **YES** when asked to install ``Smarty``.
